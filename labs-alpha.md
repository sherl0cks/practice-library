# Open Innovation Labs Process Way Points

## What Is This?

This is an attempt to define "What" happens in order to prepare for, and then successful deliver, an Open Innovation Labs residency. Think of it as a set of way points en route to a destination. We'll version control this material much like Red Hat does with products - there will be an upstream release for rapid feedback and innovation, and then specific downstream releases that are stable and will be supported for a longer period of time.

## What This Is Not

A detailed facilitation guide i.e. the "How." Where we feel strongly about facilitation techniques, will link to other resources.

## Why Is It Here?

This document was created to support two different audiences:

### For Participants (most likely you)

The objective is to understand "the Big Picture", so you have context as to "What" we plan to do, and "When" we plan to do it. You should *expect* that facilitators will change "How" they navigate the team from one way point to the next, but you should also expect that the way points themselves are fixed, except in extraordinary circumstances.

### For Facilitators

The objective is to "create alignment and enable autonomy" at two levels:

1. **The Project Level**: Without a "road map" for facilitation technique across all phases of the project, there is no effective way for facilitation teams to discuss changes. This document aims to provide such a road map for "What", not "How". You should develop consensus on each way point as well, as the collective order of the way points, at the beginning of the each project. Revisit as needed through the project.
2. **The Session Level**: Every project is different, and as such, we should expect that different projects will benefit from different techniques to navigate the team from way point to way point. Nonetheless, it's critical that variation in methodology doesn't impede the ability of the team to work together effectively, or even worse, put project objectives at risk. Therefore, way points are a license to individual facilitators to make on the fly method changes, so long as the new course still navigates the team to the originally agreed upon way point. Deviations in technique that also require a deviation to the way points require the facilitation team to come to consensus before the change is made.


## This Sounds Kinda Like SEMAT?

Yea, this is something like a SEMAT alpha, just a little different. It may make sense to change these way points to alpha states, or decompose them into multiple alphas. Suggestions welcome.

## The Process Way Points

**TODO**: provide acceptance criteria under each bullet

### Discovery

1. Identity a Goal or Problem Statement
2. Identify Assumptions
3. Prioritize Assumptions

### Approach

4. Select Key Assumptions to Test In Residency
5. Constrain the Solution Space
  e.g select technology stack, build a team, identify dates & location, etc.
6. Close the Deal

### Pre Residency

7. Assess Current State of "To Be" Business Process Definition & Team Member Skill Sets
8. Provide Homework
9. Translate Assumptions Into Hypotheses
10. Technology Due Diligence

### Residency

11. Agree Upon Planning Priorities
12. Discover the "To Be" Business Process
13. Seed the Backlog with the "To Be" Business Process
14. Take A Rough Cut At Scope for In Residency vs After Residency
15. Deliberately Discover Known Unknowns - i.e. Learn!
  (e.g. Technologies, Requirements, Integrations, Infrastructure etc.)
16. Develop a Strategy to Delivery Scope During Residency
17. Plan / Do / Measure / Demonstrate / Retrospect in Iterations Until the End of Residency
